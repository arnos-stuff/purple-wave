# Purple-Wave Format

## Installing

```bash
quarto use template arnos-stuff/purple-wave
```

This will install the extension and create an example qmd file that you can use as a starting place for your article.

## Example

Here is the source code for a minimal sample document: [example.qmd](example.qmd).

## A note

Thanks to this [stackoverflow post](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/73415662/how-can-i-use-a-quarto-extension-that-i-created-for-myself) I made this work, you should tag your repo else quarto can't figure out stuff.

```bash
git tag v0.0.1
git push --tags
```
